  The “Nigerian prince” email scam is perhaps one of the longest-running
  Internet frauds. Actress Anne Hathaway even joked about it in her monologue on
  “Saturday Night Live” over a decade ago. Also called “Nigerian letter” scams
  or “foreign money exchanges,” these typically start with an email from someone
  overseas who claims to be royalty. The fraudsters lure you in by offering a
  share of a huge investment opportunity or a fortune they can’t get out of the
  country without your help. Then they ask you either for your bank account
  number so they can transfer the money to you for safekeeping, or for a small
  advance payment to help cover the expense of transferring the money. That’s
  when they either take your payment and disappear, or, worse, drain your bank
  account. Americans lost $703,000 last year to these types of frauds, according
  to a new report by ADT Security Services, using data from the Better Business
  Bureau’s Scam Tracker. “As long as these types of scams keep working, people
  will continue to use them,” Anja Solum, ADT project manager, tells CNBC Make
  It.
