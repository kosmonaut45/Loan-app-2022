  <h1>Loan Application</h1>
  <div>
    <p>What is a loan application? A loan application is used by borrowers to apply
      for a loan. Through the loan application, borrowers reveal key details about
      their finances to the lender. The loan application is crucial to determining
      whether the lender will grant the request for funds or credit.</p>
    <p>
      Taking a personal loan can make sense when it's less expensive than other
      forms of credit and when you can comfortably afford the monthly payments
      for the duration of the loan term.
